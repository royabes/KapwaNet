# Mutual Aid Platform Landscape: Research Notes

*What others have built, what we can learn*

---

## The Research Question

What mutual aid and community sharing platforms exist? What worked? What failed? What can KapwaNet learn?

---

## Major Platforms & Projects

### 1. Mutual Aid Hub (mutualaidhub.org)

**What it is**: Directory of mutual aid groups, emerged during COVID-19

**Key features**:
- Map-based discovery of local groups
- Resource library for organizers
- Not a platform itself, but a connector

**What worked**:
- Simple, focused purpose
- Volunteer-driven
- Good documentation for starting groups

**Limitations**:
- Just a directory, not operational software
- Groups still need their own tools

**Lesson for KapwaNet**: There's a gap between "here's a list of groups" and "here's software to run your group"

---

### 2. Mutual Aid NYC (mutualaid.nyc)

**What it is**: Hyperlocal pods organized by neighborhood

**Key features**:
- Neighborhood-based organization
- Airtable-powered intake forms
- Volunteer dispatch system
- Slack/WhatsApp for coordination

**What worked**:
- Deep local trust
- Human-centered (phone calls, not just apps)
- Rapid response during COVID

**What struggled**:
- Stitched-together tools (Airtable + Slack + Google Forms)
- Volunteer burnout
- Sustainability after initial crisis

**Lesson for KapwaNet**: The need is real, but tools are fragmented. An integrated platform could reduce coordinator burden.

### 3. Buy Nothing Project

**What it is**: Hyperlocal gift economy groups (started on Facebook)

**Key features**:
- Give, receive, or lend - no money
- Geographic boundaries (neighborhoods)
- Recently launched their own app

**What worked**:
- Simple rules (free, local, kind)
- Strong culture of gratitude
- Massive scale (millions of members)

**What failed**:
- Facebook dependency was problematic
- App launch was rocky (ratings issues)
- Lost some community feel in transition

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Simplicity matters
- Don't underestimate the "community feel" - it's not just features
- Migrating off Facebook is HARD

---

### 4. Nextdoor

**What it is**: Neighborhood social network (for-profit)

**Key features**:
- Verified addresses
- Local marketplace
- Help map (added during COVID)
- Recommendations for local services

**Problems**:
- Racial profiling incidents (crime reports)
- Ad-driven model creates misaligned incentives
- Often devolves into complaints, not help
- Privacy concerns

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Verification builds trust but can exclude
- The profit motive corrupts community purpose
- Moderation is CRUCIAL
- Being explicitly about mutual aid (not general social) keeps focus

---

### 5. Olio (olioex.com)

**What it is**: Food sharing app (UK-based, now global)

**Key features**:
- Photograph surplus food
- Neighbors claim and collect
- Business partnerships (Tesco, etc.)
- "Food Waste Heroes" volunteers

**What worked**:
- Environmental angle + community angle
- Clear, focused use case (food)
- Good mobile experience
- Impact metrics prominently displayed

**Business model**:
- Free for individuals
- Paid tier for businesses
- Recently expanded beyond food

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Focus can be strength
- Impact metrics motivate participation
- Volunteer "heroes" model works

---

### 6. Freecycle

**What it is**: Original online free stuff network (founded 2003)

**Key features**:
- Email list / forum based
- Give away unwanted items
- Local groups

**What worked**:
- Pioneer in the space
- Kept stuff out of landfills
- Simple "offer/wanted" model

**What aged poorly**:
- Email-based feels dated
- Fragmented experience
- No mobile-first design
- Limited moderation tools

**Lesson for KapwaNet**: The core idea is timeless; the UX needs to be modern.

---

### 7. TimeBank / hOurworld

**What it is**: Time-based reciprocal exchange

**Key features**:
- 1 hour = 1 hour (regardless of service type)
- Everyone's time is equal value
- Track exchanges in "hours" not money

**Philosophy**:
- Developed by Edgar Cahn
- Based on "co-production" economics
- Challenges market value assumptions

**What worked**:
- Profound equity principle
- Builds unexpected connections
- Often used in aging/healthcare contexts

**Challenges**:
- Harder to explain than "free stuff"
- Requires active coordination
- Can feel transactional despite intentions

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Consider time-based component (optional?)
- The philosophy matters as much as features
- "Everyone has something to give" is powerful

---

### 8. GiveDirectly

**What it is**: Direct cash transfers to people in poverty

**Relevant because**: Challenges the "we know what you need" charity model

**Key insight**: Trust people. They know their own needs.

**Lesson for KapwaNet**: Don't be paternalistic. Let people define their own needs.

---

### 9. Lasagna Love

**What it is**: Neighbors making meals for neighbors

**What it is**:
- Sign up to receive or give a home-cooked meal
- Matching via volunteers
- No qualifications to receive (just need it)

**What worked**:
- Very specific, tangible help
- Low barrier (who can't make lasagna?)
- Human touch of home cooking
- "No explanation needed" policy

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Specificity can be powerful
- "No questions asked" reduces shame
- The personal touch matters

---

### 10. Little Free Pantry / Little Free Library

**What it is**: Physical infrastructure for sharing

**Model**: "Take what you need, leave what you can"

**What worked**:
- Physical presence in community
- Anonymous giving/receiving
- No technology barrier
- Visual reminder of community

**Lesson for KapwaNet**:
- Digital + physical hybrid?
- Anonymity reduces stigma
- Simple rules enable participation

---

## Failed or Struggling Projects

### Peerby (Netherlands)

- Neighborhood borrowing platform
- Struggled with engagement after initial hype
- Pivoted to B2B rental

**Why it struggled**:
- Borrowing requires coordination
- Often easier to just buy cheap items
- Trust for lending personal items is high bar

### NeighborGoods

- Shut down after initial funding
- Similar borrowing concept
- Couldn't achieve network effects

### Yerdle

- "Give, get, earn" platform
- Pivoted entirely to B2B (Trove)
- Consumer side couldn't sustain

## Patterns & Insights

### What Makes Platforms Succeed

1. **Clear, simple purpose**: "Give away free stuff" beats "community sharing economy platform"

2. **Geographic focus**: Hyperlocal works. Global doesn't.

3. **Low barrier to participate**: If it takes 10 minutes to post, people won't post.

4. **Trust mechanisms**: Verification, reviews, or real-name policy

5. **Active moderation**: Unmoderated platforms become toxic

6. **Mobile-first**: Most access via phone

7. **Impact visibility**: Show that it's working ("500 items shared!")

8. **Volunteer/community management**: Technology alone doesn't build community

### What Makes Platforms Fail

1. **VC-funded growth pressure**: Community can't be forced to scale

2. **Feature bloat**: Trying to do everything

3. **Ignored moderation**: Toxicity drives good people away

4. **Platform dependency**: Building on Facebook's whims

5. **No sustainability model**: Volunteers burn out

6. **Tech-first thinking**: Ignoring the human coordination needed

7. **Transactional framing**: When it feels like a marketplace, not a community

## Gap Analysis: Where KapwaNet Fits

| Need | Existing Solutions | Gap |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Mutual aid coordination | Airtable, spreadsheets, Slack | No integrated purpose-built tool |
| Item sharing | Buy Nothing, Freecycle, Olio | Platform lock-in, not org-owned |
| Help exchange | Timebanks, informal | Complex, limited adoption |
| Organization websites | WordPress, Squarespace | Not integrated with operations |
| Community building | Facebook Groups | Privacy issues, algorithm control |

**KapwaNet's unique position**:
- **Open source**: Organizations own their platform
- **Integrated**: Website + operations in one
- **Values-aligned**: Not profit-driven
- **Culturally grounded**: Kapwa philosophy, not generic "sharing economy"

---

## Recommendations Based on Research

### Steal These Ideas

1. **From Olio**: Impact counters, volunteer "heroes" program, food safety fields
2. **From Buy Nothing**: Gift economy language, gratitude culture, simple rules
3. **From TimeBanks**: "Everyone has something to give" philosophy
4. **From Lasagna Love**: "No explanation needed" policy
5. **From Little Free Pantry**: Anonymity option, simple participation

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. Don't try to be a social network (that's not the point)
2. Don't gamify in ways that feel manipulative
3. Don't require extensive profiles to participate
4. Don't let growth pressure compromise community health
5. Don't ignore the need for human coordinators

### Unanswered Questions

1. **Sustainability**: How do organizations fund ongoing operations?
2. **Scale**: Is hyperlocal the only model that works?
3. **Interoperability**: Should KapwaNet instances be able to share across orgs?
4. **Offline access**: How do we serve those without reliable internet?

---

## Conclusion

The landscape is fragmented. People use stitched-together tools because nothing purpose-built exists for organization-led mutual aid.

KapwaNet can fill this gap by being:
- The "WordPress for mutual aid organizations"
- Open source, self-hostable, community-owned
- Integrated: website + help posts + item sharing + messaging
- Culturally grounded in reciprocity, not charity

The technology is 20% of the solution. The other 80% is:
- Clear philosophy and values
- Good documentation
- Community of practice among organizations
- Sustainable funding model
