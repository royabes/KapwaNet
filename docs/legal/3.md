This is an important evolution of the idea — and it **can be done legally and respectfully** if you **separate “Bayanihan Help” from “Professional Help” very clearly**.

Below is a **complete Bayanihan Help Policy page** that:

* Preserves the **bayanihan spirit**
* Allows **legitimate professionals** to participate
* Protects the platform legally in **Alberta**
* Uses **clear, defensible boundaries**

You can publish this almost as-is on your app or website.

# Bayanihan Help & Professional Help Policy

*(Peer-to-Peer Community Platform – Alberta, Canada)*

## 1. Purpose of Bayanihan Help

This platform exists to support **bayanihan** — the Filipino tradition of **mutual aid, volunteerism, and community care**.

We enable people to:

* Offer help
* Request help
* Share skills
* Support one another

**We are a platform only.** We do not provide services, employ helpers, or certify professionals.

---

## 2. Two Distinct Types of Help on the Platform

To protect users and comply with Alberta law, the platform recognizes **two separate categories of help**:

---

## A. Bayanihan Help (Community / Volunteer Help)

### Definition

Bayanihan Help is **informal, voluntary, non-professional assistance** provided by community members **without expectation of professional standards or guarantees**.

### Examples (Allowed)

* Household help (cleaning, organizing)
* Simple repairs (bike repair, furniture assembly)
* Yard work / snow shoveling
* Moving help (lifting, carrying)
* Basic tech help (phone or computer setup)
* Tutoring or homework help (non-certified)
* Language practice
* Companionship or check-ins (non-medical)

### Restrictions

Bayanihan Help **must not** include:

* Regulated trades (electrical, plumbing, gas)
* Structural construction or renovations
* Medical, therapeutic, or personal care
* Childcare involving supervision of multiple children
* Legal, financial, or insurance advice
* Any activity requiring a license under Alberta law

### Compensation

* No fees or wages
* No pricing or hourly rates
* Optional expressions of gratitude only (thank-you notes, community points)

---

## B. Professional Help (Verified or Self-Declared)

### Definition

Professional Help refers to services offered by individuals who **claim to have formal training, certification, licensing, or professional experience**.

The platform **does not verify credentials by default** and **does not guarantee professional quality**.

### Examples (May Be Allowed)

* Certified tutors or teachers
* Licensed tradespeople (within legal scope)
* Registered professionals (where lawful)
* Skilled service providers acting independently

### Requirements for Professional Help Listings

Users offering Professional Help must:

1. Clearly identify the service as **Professional Help**
2. Accurately represent their qualifications
3. Hold any required licenses or certifications
4. Comply with all applicable Alberta laws
5. Maintain their own insurance if required

The platform:

* Does **not** verify credentials unless explicitly stated
* Does **not** supervise or control the service
* Does **not** guarantee outcomes or quality
* Does **not** act as an employer or agent

---

## 3. Platform Role & Disclaimer (Critical)

The platform:

* Is not a service provider
* Is not an employer, contractor, or agency
* Does not inspect, supervise, or direct services
* Does not ensure safety, quality, or legality of services

All users participate **at their own discretion and risk**.

---

## 4. Safety & Conduct Expectations

All users must:

* Act respectfully and lawfully
* Follow community guidelines
* Avoid discrimination or harassment
* Accurately describe services offered
* Report unsafe or misleading behavior

We reserve the right to:

* Remove listings
* Suspend or ban accounts
* Cooperate with authorities if required by law

---

## 5. Prohibited Services (Non-Negotiable)

The following are **not permitted** on the platform under any category:

* Illegal activities
* Medical diagnosis or treatment
* Therapy or counseling
* Electrical, gas, or plumbing work without licensing
* Childcare services requiring provincial licensing
* Driving or transportation services
* Any service that violates Alberta or Canadian law

---

## 6. Liability & Responsibility

Users acknowledge that:

* They are responsible for assessing safety and suitability
* They must verify credentials where relevant
* They assume all risks related to in-person interactions

The platform is **not liable** for:

* Injuries
* Property damage
* Service quality
* Disputes between users

---

## 7. Reporting & Accountability

Users may report:

* Unsafe behavior
* Misrepresentation of skills
* Illegal or prohibited services
* Harassment or discrimination

Repeated violations may result in permanent removal.

---

## 8. Cultural Commitment

This platform honors bayanihan by:

* Encouraging generosity without exploitation
* Protecting dignity for those seeking help
* Respecting professional integrity
* Ensuring safety and legal compliance

---

## Why this policy works (important insight)

✔ Preserves bayanihan values
✔ Allows professionals to participate **without turning the platform into a gig marketplace**
✔ Avoids employer and licensing liability
✔ Complies with Alberta legal expectations
✔ Scales safely

### If you want next, I can:

* Create **UX copy** for posting flows (“Choose Bayanihan or Professional”)
* Create a **verification badge system** (optional, low risk)
* Map this policy to **database fields & moderation rules**
* Draft **in-app consent checkboxes**
* Align this with a **nonprofit or social enterprise charter**

Just tell me the next step — you’re building this the right way.
