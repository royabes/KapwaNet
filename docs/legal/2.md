This is a very good and very Filipino-rooted question — and you’re right to pause here.
**“Bayanihan” changes the *spirit*, but the law still looks at *what is actually happening*.**
The good news: you *can* support bayanihan-style service help **safely and legally** in Alberta if you design it correctly.

I’ll break this down **clearly, practically, and in a way you can actually build**.

---

# 1. What “Bayanihan services” mean legally in Alberta

**Bayanihan = voluntary, community-based help**, not professional contracting.

Examples:

* Helping fix a bike
* Minor home repairs
* Tutoring a child
* Helping move furniture
* Teaching basic skills
* Yard work, snow shoveling
* Tech help (phone setup, laptop basics)

⚠️ **What the law cares about is NOT the name** — it’s:

* Is money exchanged?
* Is it regulated work?
* Is there an expectation of professional skill?
* Is the platform encouraging or organizing the service?

---

# 2. The safest legal framing: “Community Help, Not Professional Services”

### Your app should explicitly define these as:

> **“Voluntary, informal, community assistance provided without expectation of professional standards.”**

This framing:

* Avoids employment law issues
* Avoids contractor liability
* Avoids professional licensing obligations
* Matches the spirit of bayanihan

---

# 3. What you SHOULD allow (Low legal risk)

These are generally safe **if framed as voluntary help**:

### ✔ Allowed Bayanihan Service Categories

* Basic household help (cleaning, organizing)
* Simple repairs (furniture assembly, bike repair)
* Yard work / snow shoveling
* Tech help (basic device setup)
* Tutoring / homework help (non-certified)
* Moving help (lifting, carrying)
* Language practice / conversation
* Elder companionship (non-medical)

**Key common trait:**
No licensing, no safety-critical risk, no professional representation.

---

# 4. What you should RESTRICT or BLOCK (High legal risk)

These should be **prohibited or heavily restricted**:

❌ Electrical work
❌ Plumbing
❌ Structural construction
❌ Childcare involving supervision of multiple children
❌ Medical or personal care
❌ Therapy or counseling
❌ Legal or financial advice
❌ Driving passengers (liability + insurance)

Why? These are:

* Regulated professions
* High-risk for injury
* Insurance-sensitive
* Licensing-required in Alberta

---

# 5. How to design the Bayanihan feature (VERY IMPORTANT)

### A. Rename the feature intentionally

Instead of “Services,” use:

* **“Community Help”**
* **“Bayanihan Help”**
* **“Volunteer Skills”**

Language matters legally.

---

### B. Mandatory disclaimers (short & visible)

Before posting or accepting help:

> “This is voluntary, informal community help.
> The platform does not verify skills, supervise activities, or guarantee outcomes.”

Require checkbox acceptance.

---

### C. No pricing — only gratitude

To avoid “commercial activity”:

* No hourly rates
* No payments
* Optional:

  * “Thank you notes”
  * Community points
  * Badges
  * Gratitude posts

(You *can* later allow **expense reimbursement only**, clearly separated.)

---

### D. Clear service categories

Use **pre-defined categories only** (no free-text “I can do anything”):

* Household help
* Tech help
* Tutoring
* Yard help
* Moving help
* Skill sharing

Each category includes:

* What’s allowed
* What’s not allowed
* Safety notes

---

# 6. Safety & liability controls (non-negotiable)

To protect people AND the platform:

✔ Identity verification (lightweight)
✔ Reviews focused on **reliability & respect**, not skill quality
✔ No private contact info until match
✔ Report / block system
✔ Optional “public location only” suggestion
✔ Incident reporting & bans

---

# 7. Suggested Terms language (you can use this)

> **Bayanihan Help Disclaimer**
>
> Bayanihan Help listings are informal, voluntary community assistance.
> They are not professional services.
>
> The platform does not verify skills, certify providers, supervise work, or guarantee outcomes.
> Users are responsible for assessing safety and suitability.

This is legally protective and culturally aligned.

---

# 8. Why this works in Alberta

✔ Matches volunteer frameworks
✔ Avoids employment law
✔ Avoids professional regulation
✔ Avoids consumer protection law
✔ Fits PIPA privacy rules
✔ Supports cultural values without misrepresentation

This is **exactly how community mutual-aid platforms stay legally safe**.

---

# 9. Very important design principle (this will protect you)

> **Never promise outcomes.
> Never imply expertise.
> Never organize or direct the work itself.**

You connect people.
They help each other.

## If you want next, I can:

* Create a **Bayanihan Help policy page**
* Design **UX wording** for posting/accepting help
* Create a **prohibited services list**
* Map this to **database fields & categories**
* Help define a **nonprofit governance model** aligned with Filipino values

Just tell me what you want to do next — this is a strong, thoughtful concept.
