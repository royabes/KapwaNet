You’re welcome. Below is a **clean, Alberta-specific first draft** of both a **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy** tailored to your app as a **peer-to-peer platform for items + service skills**, written in **plain but legally sound language**.
(You can later have a lawyer review and finalize.)

---

Users may withdraw consent by closing their account (subject to legal retention requirements).

---

## 4. Disclosure of Information

We do **not** sell personal information.

Information may be disclosed:

# 3. Strong Legal Design Choices You’re Making (Good Decisions)

✔ Peer-to-peer only
✔ No handling of food or services
✔ No payments (or clearly optional later)
✔ Clear disclaimers + user responsibility
✔ Reporting & moderation built in

This structure **dramatically reduces legal risk in Alberta**.

## What I Can Do Next (Very Useful)

If you want, next I can:

1. **Shorten these into “plain-English” in-app versions**
2. Add **food-specific warnings & UX prompts**
3. Create a **Prohibited Items policy**
4. Create a **Safety Guidelines page**
5. Map **legal requirements → app features** (checkbox checklist for dev)

Just tell me what you want next.
